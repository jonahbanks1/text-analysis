1. Set up your environment.
2. Load your data into a python notebook.
3. Extract features from text files. by converting text files into numerical feature vectors.

countvectorizer(data) + Tfidf(data1) 

4. Run your ML algorithm.
- this part may be a bit tricky because you must run your ML as part of a pipeline for quick/neat transfromation and classification of unseen data.
5. Grid search.
6. use the best parameters discovered at gridsearch to re_clf_fit_transform the data.

7. useful tips for NLP projects.

- Removing stop words
- stemming using NLTK.
